# Automata CFG Parser and Derivation Tree Calculator

## Usage CFG Parser and Derivation Tree Calculator
- Parsing CFG like 
S->aX|aXX|b,X->a|b  (comma character used to separate to non-terminals)
- S is a start point.
- The S has to be non-terminal.
* After the console input has been parsed by cfg-parser then the result (derivation for this language) shows on the console screen
* The cfg calculator also lists "repating words"


## Usage Polish Notation
* The space character separates the stack items.
Like: 5 3 4 * +
Result should be = 12 + 5 = 17
* After the console input has been parsed by polish notation parser then the calculated result shows on the console screen
